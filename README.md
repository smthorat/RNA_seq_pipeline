## Introduction

In this project, I am working on Bacillus subtilis, a model organism in microbiology and biotechnology. Bacillus subtilis is a Gram-positive bacterium commonly found in soil and the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals. It has been extensively studied because of its ability to form endospores, its use in industrial applications (like enzyme production), and its importance in understanding bacterial gene expression and regulation.

The goal of this project is to analyze RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data using a well-defined pipeline that includes tools for quality control, read alignment, and quantification of gene expression. The data processing steps are crucial for understanding the transcriptome of Bacillus subtilis, which helps to answer questions about gene function, regulation, and response to environmental conditions.

Importance of Bacillus subtilis

Bacillus subtilis has been widely used in scientific research for several reasons:

	•	Endospore formation: Bacillus subtilis forms highly resistant spores, making it an important model for studying sporulation, stress responses, and survival mechanisms.
	•	Biotechnology: It is often used in industrial applications for the production of enzymes, such as proteases, amylases, and cellulases, which are important in detergents, food processing, and biofuel industries.
	•	Genetic studies: Bacillus subtilis is one of the best-understood bacteria, with a fully sequenced genome. Its ease of genetic manipulation allows researchers to study gene regulation, protein secretion, and metabolic pathways in detail.

By studying its RNA, we can understand how Bacillus subtilis responds to different environments and conditions, such as stress or the overproduction of specific enzymes, making it a valuable organism in both basic and applied research.

Objective of the Project

The main objective of this project is to analyze RNA-seq data from Bacillus subtilis and understand how gene expression changes under different experimental conditions. We use an RNA-seq pipeline that takes raw sequencing data and processes it into a format that can be used for downstream analysis, like identifying differentially expressed genes.

## RNA-seq Pipeline

This pipeline uses a combination of popular bioinformatics tools to process RNA-seq data. Below are the key steps involved in the pipeline:

	1.	Download Data:
	•	Data is downloaded from public repositories using tools like the SRA Toolkit.
	•	Example: Downloading paired-end FASTQ files from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA).
	2.	Quality Control:
	•	We use FastQC to evaluate the quality of the raw RNA-seq reads. FastQC generates a report that highlights issues such as adapter content and sequence duplication.
	3.	Trimming:
	•	Using Trimmomatic, we trim the RNA-seq reads to remove adapters and low-quality bases. This step ensures that the data is clean and ready for alignment.
	4.	Alignment:
	•	We align the trimmed reads to the Bacillus subtilis reference genome using HISAT2. This step generates a SAM/BAM file with the aligned reads, showing how the RNA fragments map to the genome.
	5.	Gene Expression Quantification:
	•	Using featureCounts from the Subread package, we quantify how many RNA-seq reads are mapped to each gene. This gives us raw counts that can be used for downstream analysis.
	6.	Data Transfer:
	•	We use SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) to transfer the results from the high-performance computing (HPC) environment to our local machine for further analysis.

	•	Gene Regulation: We can identify genes that are upregulated or downregulated in response to specific environmental conditions, treatments, or stress.
	•	Biotechnology: Understanding how Bacillus subtilis regulates enzyme production can help optimize industrial processes for large-scale enzyme production.
	•	Sporulation and Stress Responses: By studying changes in gene expression during sporulation or stress, we can learn how Bacillus subtilis survives in harsh conditions, which is important in fields like microbiology and food safety.
